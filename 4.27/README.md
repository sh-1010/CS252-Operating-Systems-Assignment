Programming exercise 4.27

The Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, .... Formally, it can be expressed as:
fib0 = 0
fib1 = 1
fibn = fibn−1 + fibn−2
Write a multithreaded program that generates the Fibonacci sequence.
This program should work as follows: On the command line, the user
will enter the number of Fibonacci numbers that the program is to generate. The program will then create a separate thread that will generate
the Fibonacci numbers, placing the sequence in data that can be shared
by the threads (an array is probably the most convenient data structure). When the thread finishes execution, the parent thread will output
the sequence generated by the child thread. Because the parent thread
cannot begin outputting the Fibonacci sequence until the child thread
finishes, the parent thread will have to wait for the child thread to finish.

Solution approach

Pthread library was used to solve the exercise

How to compile and run

Compile: gcc -o cs2 cs2.c -pthread

Run: ./cs2 \<parameter>
